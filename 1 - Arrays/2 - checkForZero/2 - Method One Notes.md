# Question 2: Check if subarray with 0, exists

Given: An unsorted array of integers, find a pair with given sum in it
Output: Any subarray values with 0 sum 

### Solving plan:
   - [ ] Step 1
   - [ ] Step 2
   - [ ] Step 3

### Target:
      Time complex: O(n^2)
### Space:
      Space complex: O(1)

### Ex:
	Input:
		arr = [8,7,2,5,3,1]
		sum = 10
	Output:



### Result:
   The time complexity for both is 
   
   The space complexity for both is
